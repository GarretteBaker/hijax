Hi, JAX!
========

"Hi, JAX!" is a short introduction to [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/) for
deep learning researchers.
See the [course website](https://far.in.net/hijax) for details or to express
interest.

This repository holds code relevant to each session. It's currently under
development.
There is one folder for each session/project. There are three branches
containing different versions of the projects in parallel.

* `main`: contains the base code required for the start of each session.
* `soln`: based on `main`, but including pre-worked solutions where
  available.
* `live`: based on `main`, in which the demonstrations will take place, with
  the aim of resembling `soln` by the end of each session.

Participants are encouraged to fork this repository and work on their own
solutions from `main`, comparing to the `soln` branch as necessary.
Participants are also encouraged to implement their own projects and share
them via keeping their forks public.

Issues and pull requests are also welcome.
